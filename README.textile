h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(RailsApps Page Gem)! RailsApps Pages Gem

Use this gem to add pages to a Rails application, including controllers, views, routing, and tests.

RailsApps Pages is a utility gem to use during development. You can remove it after generating the pages you need. It was originally written for use by the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool. Use Rails Composer to build any of the "RailApps example applications":http://railsapps.github.io/ for use as starter apps.

If you like the RailsApps Pages gem, you might be interested in the "RailsLayout gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout which generates Rails application layout files for various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.

h4. Support the RailsApps Project

If the RailsApps Pages gem is useful to you, please accept our invitation to "join the RailsApps project":http://railsapps.github.io/. The RailsApps project provides example applications, tutorials, and starter tools, including the RailsApps Pages gem.

h2. Install the Gem

Add the gem to your Rails application Gemfile:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_pages'
end
</pre>

You don't need the RailsApps Pages gem deployed to production, so put it in the @development@ group.

If you want to use a newer unreleased version from GitHub:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_pages', github: 'RailsApps/rails_apps_pages'
end
</pre>

h4. Use Bundler

Use Bundler to install the gems:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

h2. Generate a Home Page

To run the generator and create a home page:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:home
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/views/visitors/index.html.erb
* app/controllers/visitors_controller.rb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

It will add a route to the *config/routes.rb* file:

<pre>
root :to => "visitors#index"
</pre>

Why a "Visitors" controller? Why not a "Home" controller or "Welcome" controller? Those names are acceptable. But the home page often implements a user story for a persona named "visitor," so a "Visitors" controller is appropriate.

h2. Generate an "About" Page

To run the generator and create an "About" page:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:about
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/views/pages/about.html.erb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

You'll need to install the "high_voltage gem":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage for the "About" page. The high_voltage gem makes it easy to add pages with static content (text that doesn't change), incorporating a site-wide application layout. The high_voltage gem provides the controller and routes needed to display any pages found in the *app/views/pages/* folder.

h2. Generate User Pages Requiring Authentication

If you have a User model and authentication with Devise, you can add pages to display a list of users or each user's profile, restricted to signed in users.

To run the generator and create pages to accompany a User model:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:users
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/controllers/registrations_controller.rb
* app/controllers/users_controller.rb
* app/controllers/visitors_controller.rb
* app/views/users/_user.html.erb
* app/views/users/index.html.erb
* app/views/users/show.html.erb
* app/views/visitors/index.html.erb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

It will add routes to the *config/routes.rb* file:

<pre>
root :to => "visitors#index"
devise_for :users, :controllers => {:registrations => "registrations"}
resources :users
</pre>

h2. Generate User Pages Requiring Authorization

If you have a User model, authentication with Devise, and authorization with Pundit, you can add pages to display a list of users, restricted to an administrator. Each user can see his or her own profile if logged in.

To run the generator and create pages to accompany a User model with Pundit authorization:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:authorized
</pre>

All files are identical to the @rails generate pages:users@ generator, except:

* app/views/users/_user.html.erb
* app/controllers/users_controller.rb
* app/policies/user_policy.rb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

h2. Clean a Gemfile

Remove commented lines and multiple blank lines from a Gemfile:

<pre>
$ rails generate clean:gemfile
</pre>

h2. Clean a Routes File

Remove commented lines and multiple blank lines from the file *config/routes.rb*:

<pre>
$ rails generate clean:routes
</pre>
