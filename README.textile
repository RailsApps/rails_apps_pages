h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(RailsApps Page Gem)! RailsApps Pages Gem

Use this gem to add pages to a Rails application, including controllers, views, routing, and tests.

RailsApps Pages is a utility gem to use during development. You can remove it after generating the pages you need. It was originally written for use by the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool. Use Rails Composer to build any of the "RailApps example applications":http://railsapps.github.io/ for use as starter apps.

If you like the RailsApps Pages gem, you might be interested in the "RailsLayout gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout which generates Rails application layout files for various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.

h4. From the RailsApps Project

The "RailsApps":http://railsapps.github.io/ open source project offers starter applications and tutorials for Rails developers. Generate the applications with the Rails Composer tool.

All the code is explained in the Capstone Rails Tutorials. You can purchase the "Capstone Rails Tutorials":https://tutorials.railsapps.org/ to support the project.

h2. Install the Gem

Add the gem to your Rails application Gemfile:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_pages'
end
</pre>

You don't need the RailsApps Pages gem deployed to production, so put it in the @development@ group.

If you want to use a newer unreleased version from GitHub:

<pre>
group :development do
  gem 'rails_apps_pages', github: 'RailsApps/rails_apps_pages'
end
</pre>

h4. Use Bundler

Use Bundler to install the gems:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

h2. Generate a Home Page

To run the generator and create a home page:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:home
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/views/visitors/index.html.erb
* app/controllers/visitors_controller.rb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

It will add a route to the *config/routes.rb* file:

<pre>
root :to => "visitors#index"
</pre>

Why a "Visitors" controller? Why not a "Home" controller or "Welcome" controller? Those names are acceptable. But the home page often implements a user story for a persona named "visitor," so a "Visitors" controller is appropriate.

h2. Generate an "About" Page

To run the generator and create an "About" page:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:about
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/views/pages/about.html.erb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

You'll need to install the "high_voltage gem":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage for the "About" page. The high_voltage gem makes it easy to add pages with static content (text that doesn't change), incorporating a site-wide application layout. The high_voltage gem provides the controller and routes needed to display any pages found in the *app/views/pages/* folder.

h2. Generate User Pages Requiring Authentication

If you have a User model and authentication with Devise or OmniAuth, you can add pages to display a list of users or each user's profile, restricted to signed in users.

To run the generator and create pages to accompany a User model:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:users
</pre>

The generator will create:

* app/controllers/users_controller.rb
* app/controllers/visitors_controller.rb
* app/views/users/_user.html.erb
* app/views/users/index.html.erb
* app/views/users/show.html.erb
* app/views/visitors/index.html.erb

It will also add routes to the *config/routes.rb* file.

h2. Generate User Pages Requiring Authorization

If you have a User model, authentication with Devise, and authorization with Pundit, you can add pages to display a list of users, restricted to an administrator. Each user can see his or her own profile if logged in.

To run the generator and create pages to accompany a User model with Pundit authorization:

<pre>
$ rails generate pages:authorized
</pre>

All files are identical to the @rails generate pages:users@ generator, except:

* app/views/users/_user.html.erb
* app/controllers/users_controller.rb
* app/policies/user_policy.rb
* plus tests (if RSpec is installed)

h2. Clean a Gemfile

Remove commented lines and multiple blank lines from a Gemfile:

<pre>
$ rails generate clean:gemfile
</pre>

h2. Clean a Routes File

Remove commented lines and multiple blank lines from the file *config/routes.rb*:

<pre>
$ rails generate clean:routes
</pre>

h2. Generate Analytics Files

Add a file containing JavaScript code to set up page-view tracking with "Google Analytics":http://www.google.com/analytics/:

<pre>
$ rails generate analytics:google
</pre>

Add a file containing JavaScript code to set up page-view tracking with "Segment.io":https://segment.io/:

<pre>
$ rails generate analytics:segmentio
</pre>

h2. Generate Bootstrap Page Layouts

See the "Start Bootstrap":http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/ site for a collection of Bootstrap themes and templates that you can generate with the rails_apps_pages gem.

Here are the Bootstrap page layouts you can generate:

<pre>
 1)  None
 2)  1 Col Portfolio
 3)  2 Col Portfolio
 4)  3 Col Portfolio
 5)  4 Col Portfolio
 6)  Bare
 7)  Blog Home
 8)  Business Casual
 9)  Business Frontpage
10)  Clean Blog
11)  Full Width Pics
12)  Heroic Features
13)  Landing Page
14)  Modern Business
15)  One Page Wonder
16)  Portfolio Item
17)  Round About

19)  Shop Item
20)  Simple Sidebar
21)  Small Business
22)  Stylish Portfolio
23)  The Big Picture
24)  Thumbnail Gallery
</pre>

To see the commands that generate the Bootstrap page layouts, run:

<pre>
$ rails g
</pre>
