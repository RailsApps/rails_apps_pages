Use this gem to add pages to a Rails application, including controllers, views, and routing.

RailsApps Pages is a utility gem to use during development. You can remove it after setting up your test framework. It was originally written for use by the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool. Use Rails Composer to build any of the "RailApps example applications":http://railsapps.github.io/ for use as starter apps.

If you like the RailsApps Pages gem, you might be interested in the "RailsLayout gem":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout which generates Rails application layout files for various front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.
